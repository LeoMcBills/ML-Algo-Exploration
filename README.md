This is an open-source project established under Mbarara University Biomedical Engineering Association (MBUBESA) an association in Mbarara University of Science and Technology under the faculty of Applied Science and Technology.
It is meant to equip those interested in learning Machine Learning algorithms for medicine. You don't have to be so good at programming to participate in this project otherwise there's also a python section for those that don't know how to program in python yet as it is the main language used for our machine learning programs. Please <b>please</b> check out the <b>How to Contribute</b> section inorder to contribute otherwise let's develope sustainable machine learning models for healthcare together.
